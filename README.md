# FISH WEIGHT ESTIMATION ML MODEL
This repository contains my solution to the [IEEE ENSI CIS Chapter](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ieee-ensi-computational-intelligence-society-chapter/) Mini Friendly Competition as well as the provided files.

## Competition Description
We have fish farms that are equipped with cameras which can allow us to get measurements of the swimming fish. We are asked to use those measurements to estimate their weights using a Machine Learning model.

## Files
- `Starter_Notebook.ipynb` contains the competition details.
- `SampleSubmissionFile.csv` shows the format of the submitted file.
- `Train.csv` contains the training set.
- `Test.csv` contains the test set.
- `My_Notebook.ipynb` contains my solution to the competition.

## Final Standing
- My score was 86%.
- [I got 2nd place.](https://www.facebook.com/IEEE.ENSI.CIS/photos/a.376615966249501/1053648195212938/)
